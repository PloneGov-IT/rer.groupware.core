Groupware Manual
================

Quick how-to start with RER Groupware.

Create a new group
------------------

Just create a new room inside the portal root (let's cal it "*XXX*").

Add new coordinators to the group
---------------------------------

Managers use the Simple Group Management interface (SGM) to add new user(s) to the *xxx* and
*xxx.coordinators* group.

After that, the Manager must manually add the group to the SimpleGroupManagement configuration::

    xxx.coordinator|xxx

This last step must be done only for the first coordinator; additional coordinators must simply be added
to the *xxx* and *xxx.coordinator* group.

Add normal members to the group
-------------------------------

Coordinators (and also Manager) *must* use the Simple Group Management interface for handle members
of the group.

This because only with this user interface, users are also added to the right nofitication groups.
